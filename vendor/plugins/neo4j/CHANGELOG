== 0.3.0 / 2009-06-25
* Neo4j should track node changes
* RESTful support for lucene queries, sorting and paging
* RESTful support for Relationships
* RESTful support for Node and properties
* Experimental support for Master-Slave	Replication via REST
* RESTful Node representation should contain hyperlinks to relationships
* Added some handy method like first and empty? on relationships
* Use new neo4j: neo-1.0-b8
* Add an event handler for create/delete nodes start/stop neo, update property/relationship
* The NodeMixin should behave like a hash, added [] and []= methods
* Support list topology - has_list and belongs_to_list Neo4j::NodeMixin Classmethods
* Should be possible to add relationships without declaring them (Neo4j#relationships.outgoing(:friends) << node)
* Neo4j extensions file structure, should be easy to create your own extensions
* Rename relation to relationship (Neo4j::Relations => Neo4j::Relationships, DynamicRelation => Relationship) [data incompatible change]
* Auto Transaction is now optional
* Setting Float properties fails under JRuby1.2.0
* Bug: Indexing relationships does not work
* Make the ReferenceNode include Neo4j::NodeMixin
* Added handy Neo4j class that simply includes the Neo4j::NodeMixin
* Neo4j::IndexNode now holds references to all nodes (Neo4j.ref_node -> Neo4j::IndexNode -> ...)


== 0.2.1 / 2009-03-15
* Refactoring of lucene indexing of the node space (28)
* Fixed bug on Neo4j::Nodemixin#property? (#22)


== 0.2.0 / 2009-01-20
* Impl. Neo4j::Node#traverse - enables traversal and filtering using TraversalPosition info (#17,#19)
* Impl. traversal to any depth (#15)
* Impl. traversal several relationships type at the same time (#16)
* Fixed a Lucene timezone bug (#20)
* Lots of refactoring of the neo4j.rb traversal code and RSpecs

== 0.1.0 / 2008-12-18
* Property can now be of any type (and not only String, Fixnum, Float)
* Indexing and Query with Date and DateTime
* YARD documentation
* Properties can be removed
* A property can be set to nil (it will then be removed).

== 0.0.7 / 2008-12-10
* Added method to_param and methods on the value object needed for Ruby on Rails
* Impl. update from a value object/hash for a node
* Impl. generation of value object classes/instances from a node.
* Refactoring the Transaction handling (reuse PlaceboTransaction instances if possible)
* Removed the need to start and stop neo. It will be done automatically when needed.


== 0.0.6 / 2008-12-03
* Removed the configuration from the Neo4j.start method. Now exist in Neo4j::Config and Lucene::Config.
* Implemented sort_by method.
* Lazy loading of search result. Execute the query and load the nodes only if needed.
* Added support to use lucene query language, example: Person.find("name:foo AND age:42")
* All test now uses RAM based lucene indexes.

== 0.0.5 / 2008-11-17
* Supports keeping lucene index in memory instead of on disk
* Added support for lucene full text search
* Fixed so neo4j runs on JRuby 1.1.5
* Implemented support for reindex all instances of a node class. This is needed if the lucene index is kept in memory or if the index is changed.
* Added ReferenceNode. All nodes now have a relationship from this reference node.
* Lots of refactoring
* Added the IMDB example. It shows how to create a neo database, lucene queries and node traversals.

== 0.0.4 / 2008-10-23
* First release to rubyforge
